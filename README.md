# Quiz
In this app, I have created a simple Quiz. The subject of questions is Computer Science in this app but you can make it as you like.The app in this reads questions from file stored in assets and mark you 
out of 50 overall for your performance.The questions are asked one by one  using a single layout as you will see as I proceed.
You can skip question.Once you entered in particular subject's quiz you can't give it again.
